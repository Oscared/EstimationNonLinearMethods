# EstimationNonLinearMethods
Project in the course EL2320 Applied Estimation. Estimating non-linear predictions and measurements using EKF, iEKF and UKF. 

This project contains two version estimating the movement of an inverted pendulum on and off a cart. The estimation methods used is EKF, iEKF and UKF.
The different methods were tried using different parameters to see the behaviour of the filters, different models were also tried to evaluate their performance.
The report, important parameter settings and instructions will be uploaded here in meantime.
